# IIS Testing Summary

## Current Status ‚úÖ

Your React application is now ready for IIS testing! Here's what we've accomplished:

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
1. **IIS is installed and running** on your system
2. **Application built successfully** with `npm run build:iis`
3. **web.config file** properly configured and copied to dist folder
4. **All assets** (CSS, JS, images) are properly built and optimized
5. **Local test server** running on port 3000 for basic testing

### üìÅ Build Output
Your `dist` folder contains:
- `index.html` - Main application file
- `web.config` - IIS configuration for routing
- `assets/` - All CSS, JS, and image files
- `robots.txt`, `favicon.ico` - Additional web files

## Testing Options

### Option 1: Local Server (Currently Running) üåê
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Running
- **Purpose**: Basic functionality testing
- **Limitation**: Won't test IIS-specific features like URL rewriting

### Option 2: IIS Deployment (Requires Admin) üñ•Ô∏è
- **URL**: http://localhost/summit-scroll-motion
- **Status**: ‚è≥ Requires administrator setup
- **Purpose**: Full IIS testing including URL rewriting

## Next Steps

### For Immediate Testing (No Admin Required)
1. **Open your browser** and go to: http://localhost:3000
2. **Test basic functionality**:
   - Home page loads correctly
   - Navigation between pages works
   - All images and styles display properly
   - Contact forms work (if any)

### For Full IIS Testing (Requires Administrator)
1. **Ask your system administrator** to:
   - Create folder: `C:\inetpub\wwwroot\summit-scroll-motion`
   - Copy all files from `.\dist\` to that folder
   - Verify URL Rewrite Module is installed

2. **Test these URLs** once deployed:
   - Home: http://localhost/summit-scroll-motion/
   - About: http://localhost/summit-scroll-motion/about
   - Services: http://localhost/summit-scroll-motion/services
   - Contact: http://localhost/summit-scroll-motion/contact

## Critical Tests for IIS

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators
- All pages load without errors
- Direct navigation to `/about` works (not 404)
- Page refresh on sub-routes works
- All images and styles load properly
- Navigation between pages is smooth

### ‚ùå Common Issues
- **404 errors on direct navigation**: URL Rewrite Module missing
- **Blank pages**: JavaScript errors in browser console
- **Missing assets**: Incorrect file paths

## Troubleshooting

### If you get 404 errors on direct navigation:
1. Verify `web.config` exists in IIS folder
2. Check if URL Rewrite Module is installed
3. Ask administrator to install from: https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite

### If static assets don't load:
1. Check browser developer tools (F12)
2. Look for failed requests in Network tab
3. Verify file paths are correct

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Rebuild application
npm run build:iis

# Check IIS status
Get-Service -Name W3SVC

# Check local server status
netstat -an | findstr :3000

# Stop local server (if needed)
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where serve is running
```

## Files Created for You

1. **`LOCAL-IIS-TESTING.md`** - Detailed IIS setup guide
2. **`simple-iis-test.md`** - Simplified testing without admin rights
3. **`test-app.ps1`** - Build verification script
4. **`IIS-DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Production deployment guide

## Current Local Server Status

- **Status**: ‚úÖ Running
- **Port**: 3000
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **Purpose**: Basic functionality testing

You can now test your application at http://localhost:3000 to verify everything works correctly before deploying to IIS!
