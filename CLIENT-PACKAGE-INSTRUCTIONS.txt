IMPORTANT: CORRECT IIS DEPLOYMENT FILES
==========================================

Dear Client,

We apologize for the confusion. The previous package contained source code files that needed to be compiled first. 

THIS PACKAGE CONTAINS THE CORRECT STATIC FILES FOR IIS:

✅ WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE IN THIS PACKAGE:
- index.html           (Main website file)
- web.config           (IIS configuration - CRITICAL!)
- assets/ folder       (Contains CSS, JavaScript, and images)
- favicon.ico          (Website icon)
- robots.txt           (Search engine instructions)
- placeholder.svg      (Default image)
- lovable-uploads/     (Additional images)

✅ SIMPLE DEPLOYMENT STEPS:

1. Extract ALL files from the ZIP to your IIS website directory
   Example: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\yourwebsite\

2. Make sure ALL files are copied, especially:
   - web.config (this is critical for routing)
   - assets/ folder (contains the website code)

3. In IIS Manager:
   - Point your website to the folder containing these files
   - Make sure "URL Rewrite Module" is installed in IIS
   - Start the website

4. Test by visiting:
   - http://yourwebsite.com/
   - http://yourwebsite.com/about
   - http://yourwebsite.com/services
   - http://yourwebsite.com/contact

✅ THIS IS NOW A SIMPLE STATIC WEBSITE:
- No compilation needed
- No Node.js required on server
- Just copy files to IIS and it works
- All routing handled automatically by web.config

If you have any issues, please let us know immediately.

Best regards,
Your Development Team
